# skuperfect

SKU Perfect helps e-commerce brands track their content and pricing across retailers. It scrapes listings from major sellers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, evaluating each productsâ€™ visibility and competitiveness on relevant search terms and recommending solutions. A python-based platform, SKU Perfect utilizes Flask, MySQL, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

The front-end is mainly saved in [index_3.html](https://github.com/jwinick/skuperfect/blob/main/app/templates/index_3.html), while the backend is written in [routes.py](https://github.com/jwinick/skuperfect/blob/main/app/main/routes.py).
